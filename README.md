# AVL-Tree
The program implements a simple AVL tree and its functions such as Initialization, Insertion, Deletion and Search.

# File Structure:
1) avltree.java: Contains the class avltree and main method. The entry point for execution is in this file.
2) Node.java: Contains the class Node.
3) Makefile: make file to create java class files which can be further executed.
4) Input.txt: Contains the input data which the main method reads and makes function calls. The input file name is not hard coded and it can have any name. Preferably it
should be a text file.
5) output_file.txt(optional): contains output data for test case 1. After each test this file gets overridden with new output. The file name output_file.txt is hardcoded.
